# lastbook

<p>Development of an Android application to integrate data from various sources. Data contain information about books, like Title,author,price,description, etc. An automated tool, Import.io, is used to parse data from each web page and then with a script PHP they are cleaned and stored on the server. Then the user can view the books just from the app and don't have to navigate each publisher's web page. Moreover, the user can view on a map the bookstores around his own GPS position and if he's close to a 'known' position, he can win a book if he's the first one reaching that position. This is done using the GoogleMap API. The app is developed in Java with the Android Studio IDE</p>
